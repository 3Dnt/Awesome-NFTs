METAVERSE AND MONEY. Decrypting the Future. Report by Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions. 

Simplified Version of the Metaverse Ecosystem

    The Space: A shared, open, virtual world environment which people can access via the internet with rich multi-layered interactions. This calls for persistent, realtime connections, high bandwidth networks, and exchange centers, among other items, that create an immersive digital experience.
The Interface: Refers to the hardware that helps users access the Metaverse and includes Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) headsets, mobile devices, PC and game consoles, smart glasses, and other sensory tools.  
The Monetary Infrastructure: Refers to what supports digital payment processes, allowing users to purchase/sell digital assets in the Metaverse. This could either be fiat on-ramps or pure-play digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies.  
The Compute: Refers to the enablement and supply of computing power to support the Metaverse structure. This is the software that brings objects into 3D and allows users to interact with them. In practice, the Metaverse could resemble a combination of existing technologies and ones still in development, all working together to create a tangible, digital layer on top of reality. These systems can either be centralized, decentralized, or hybrid.
